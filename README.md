## Game Overview

In Shadow Moto, players must ride their dirt bike to the finish line across a hilly and rugged path. The game features realistic physics, allowing for flips, wheelies, and stunts. If the player crashes or the rider's head hits the ground, a quiz appears. Answering the question correctly revives the player at the same spot. An incorrect answer results in game over.
